welcome to huberman lab Essentials where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable 
science-based tools for mental health physical health and performance I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a 
professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we're going to talk 
about an extremely important topic that's Central to our daily life and that's motivation we're going to
 talk about pleasure and reward what underlies our sense of pleasure or reward we're going to talk about 
 addictions as well we're going to talk about the neurochemistry of drive and mindset but for now let's 
 just talk about the Neuroscience of motivation and reward of Pleasure and Pain because those are 
 Central to what we think of as emotions whether or not we feel good whether or not we feel we're on 
 track in life whether or not we feel we're falling behind so motivation is fundamental to our daily 
  it's what allows us to get out of bed in the morning it's what allows us to pursue longterm goals or 
  short-term goals motivation and the chemistry of motivation is tightly wound in with the 
  neurochemistry of movement in fact the same single molecule dopamine is responsible for our sense of 
  motivation and for movement it's a fascinating molecule and it lies at the center of so many great 
  things in life and it lies at the center of so many terrible aspects of Life namely addiction and 
  certain forms of mental disease so if ever there was a double-edged blade in the world of Neuroscience 
  it's dopamine there's a fundamental relationship between dopamine released in your brain and your 
  desire to exert effort and you can actually control the schedule of dopamine release but it requires 
  the appropriate knowledge this is one of those cases where understanding the way the dopamine system 
  works will allow you to leverage it to your benefit let's get a few basic facts on the table dopamine 
  was discovered in the late 1950s and it was discovered as the precursor meaning the thing from which 
  epinephrine or adrenaline is made epinephrine is the same thing as adrenaline except in the brain we 
  call it epinephrine epinephrine allows us to get into action it stimulates changes in the blood 
  vessels in the heart in the organs and tissues of the body that bias us for movement dopamine was 
  initially thought to be just the building block for epinephrine however dopamine does a lot of things 
  on its own it's not always converted to epinephrine dopamine is released from several sites in the 
  brain and body but perhaps the most important one for today's discussion about motivation and reward 
  is something that sometimes just called the reward pathway for the afficianados it's sometimes called 
  the misol limic reward pathway but it's fundamentally important to your desire to engage in action and
   it's fundamentally important for people getting addicted to substances or behaviors so how does this 
   work well you've got a structure in the Deep part of your brain called the VTA the VTA or vental 
   tegmental area contains neurons that send what we call axons little wires that spit out dopamine at a
    different structure called the nucleus accumbent and those two structures VTA and nucleus accumbent 
     really the core Machinery of the reward pathway and the pathway that controls your motivation for
      anything you can think of them like an accelerator they bias you for Action however within the 
      reward pathway there's also a break the break or restriction on that dopamine which controls when 
      it's released and how much it's released is the prefrontal cortex the prefrontal cortex is the 
      neural real estate right behind your forehead you hear about it for decisionmaking executive 
      function for planning Etc and indeed it's responsible for a lot of those it's this really unique 
      real estate that we were all endowed with as humans other animals don't have much of it we have a 
      lot of it and that prefrontal cortex acts as a break on the dopamine system and that brings us to 
      the important feature of motivation which is that motivation is a two-part process which is about 
      balancing Pleasure and Pain so when you're just sitting around not doing much of anything this 
      reward pathway is releasing dopamine at a rate of about three or four times per second it's kind 
      of firing in a low level if suddenly you get excited about something you anticipate something not 
      receive an award but you get excited in an anticipatory way then the rate of firing the rate of 
      activity in this reward pathway suddenly increases to like 30 or 40 times and it has the effect of 
      creating a sense of action or desire to move in the direction of the thing that you're craving in 
      fact it's fair to say that dopamine is responsible for wanting and for craving and that's 
      distinctly different from the way that you hear it talked about normally which is that it's 
      involved in pleasure so yes dopamine is released in response to sex it's released in response to 
      food it's released in response to a lot of things but it's mostly released in anticipation and 
      craving for a particular thing it has the effect of narrowing our Focus for the thing that We 
      crave and that thing could be as simple as a cup of coffee it could be as um important as a big 
      board meeting it could be a big final exam it could be uh the person that we're excited to meet or 
      see dopamine doesn't care about what you're craving it just releases at a particular rate if we 
      just take a step back and we look at the scientific data on how much the dopamine firing increases 
      in response to different things you get a pretty interesting window into how your brain works and 
      why you might be motivated or not motivated let's say you're hungry or you're looking forward to a 
      cup of coffee or you're going to see your partner well well your dopamine neurons are firing at a 
      low rate until you start thinking about the thing that you want or the thing that you're looking 
      forward to when you eat that food the amount of dopamine that's released in this reward pathway 
      goes up about 50% above Baseline sex which is fundamental to our species continuation and 
      reproduction sex does release dopamine and it increases dopamine levels about 100% so basically 
      doubles them Nic increases the amount of dopamine about 150% above Baseline cocaine and 
      amphetamine increase the amount of dopamine that's released a thousandfold within about 10 seconds 
      of consuming the drug however just thinking about food about sex about nicotine if you like 
      nicotine or cocaine or amphetamine can increase the amount of dopamine that's released to the same 
      degree as actually consuming the drug now it depends in some cases for instance the cocaine user 
      the addict that wants cocaine can't just think about cocaine and increase the amount of that's 
      released about a thousandfold it's actually much lower but it's just enough to put them on the 
      motivation track for to Crave that particular thing now there are reasons why you would have brain 
      circuitry like this I mean brain circuitry like this didn't evolve to get you addicted brain 
      circuitry like this evolved in order to motivate behaviors toward particular goals water when 
      you're thirsty sex and in order to reproduce these things and these brain areas and neurons were 
      part of the evolutionary history that led to the continuation of our species things like cocaine 
      and amphetamine are disastrous for most people because they release so much dopamine and they 
      create these closed Loops where people then only crave the particular thing cocaine amphetamine 
      that leads to those massive amounts of dopamine release most things don't release that that level 
      of dopamine now nowadays there's a ton of Interest in social media and in video games and it there 
      have been some measurements of the amount of dopamine released video games especially video games 
      that have a very high update speed where there's novel territory all the time novelty is a big 
      stimulus of dopamine those can release dopamine somewhere between nicotine and cocaine so very 
      high levels of dopamine release social media is an interesting one because the amount of dopamine 
      that's released in response to logging onto social media initi could be quite high but it seems 
      like likely that there's a taper in the amount of dopamine but and yet people still get addicted 
      so why why is it that we can get addicted to things that fail to get to elicit the same massive 
      amount of pleasure that they initially did being addicted to something isn't just about the fact 
      that it feels so good that you want to do it over and over again and that's because of this 
      pleasure pain balance that underlies motivation so let's look a little bit closer at the pleasure 
      pain balance because therein lies the tools for you to be able to control motivation toward 
      healthy things and avoid motivated behaviors towards things that are destructive for you there are 
      a lot of reasons why people try novel behaviors whether not those are drugs or whether not those 
      are Adventure thrill-seeking things or you know they take a new class as you'll notice I'm not 
      placing any judgment or value on these different behaviors although I think it's fair to point out 
      that for most people addictive drugs like cocaine and amphetamine are very destructive actually we 
      know that about 15 to 20% of people have a genetic bias towards addiction that you know you 
      sometimes hear that the first time that you use a drug you can become addicted to it that's 
      actually not been shown to be true for most things and most people but for some people that 
      actually is true but in any case the way that addiction works and the way that motivation Works 
      generally in the non-addictive setting is that when you anticipate something a little bit of 
      dopamine is released and then when you reach that thing you engage in that thing the amount of 
      dopamine goes up even further but as you repeatedly pursue a behavior and you repeatedly engage 
      with a particular thing let's say you love running or you love chocolate as you eat a piece of 
      chocolate believe it or not it tastes good and then there's a shift away from activation of 
      dopamine and there are other chemicals that are released that trigger a low-level sense of pain 
      now you you might not feel it as physical pain but the craving that you feel is both one part 
      dopamine and one part the mirror image of dopamine which is the pain or the craving for yet 
      another piece of chocolate and this is a very important and subtle feature of the dopamine system 
      that's not often discussed people always talk about just as pleasure you love social media so it 
      gives you dopamine and so you engage in that you like chocolate it releases dopamine so you do 
      that but for every bit of dopamine that's released there's another circuit in the brain that 
      creates you can think of it as kind of like a downward deflection in pleasure so you engage in 
      something you really want and there's an increase in pleasure and then there's a without you doing 
      anything there's a mirror image of that which is a downward deflection and pleasure which we're 
      calling pain so for every bit of pleasure there is a mirror image experience of pain and they 
      overlap in time very closely so it's sometimes hard to sense this but try it the next time you eat 
      something really delicious you'll take a bite it tastes delicious and part of experience is to 
      want more of that thing this is true for any pleasureful experience now the Diabolical part about 
      dopamine is that because it didn't evolve in order to get you to indulge in more and more and more 
      of something what happens is that initially you experience an in an increase in pleasure and you 
      also experience this increase in pain shortly after or woven in with the pleasure that makes you 
      want more of that thing but with each subsequent time that you encounter that thing the experience 
      of dopamine release and pleasure is diminished a little bit and the Diabolical thing is that the 
      pain response is increased a little bit and this is best observed in the context of drug-seeking 
      behavior the first time someone decides to take cocaine or amphetamine they will experience a huge 
      dopamine release and they will feel likely very good however the next time they take it it won't 
      feel quite as good and it won't feel even as good the third time or the next time but the amount 
      of pain the amount of craving that they experience for the drug will increase over time so much of 
      our pursuit of pleasure is simply to reduce the pain of craving so the next time you experience 
      something you really like I don't want to take you out of that experience but it's really 
      important that you notice this that if there's something you really enjoy part of that enjoyment 
      is about the anticipation and wanting of more of that thing and that's the pain system in action 
      and so we can distinguish between dopamine which is really about pleasure and dopamine which is 
      really about motivation to pursue more in order to relieve or exclude future pain let me repeat 
      that dopamine isn't as much about pleasure as much as it is about motivation and desire to pursue 
      more in order to reduce the amount of pain and we are now talking about pain as a psychological 
      pain and a craving although people that Miss a lover very badly or that really crave a food very 
      badly or that are addicted to a drug and can't access it will experience that as a physical 
      craving and a mental craving the body and brain are linked in this way it's almost they'll 
      describe it as painful they yearn for it and I think the word yearning is one that's very valuable 
      in this context because yearning seems to include a whole body experience more than just wanting 
      which could just be up in the mind mind so your desire for something is proportional to how 
      pleasureful it is to indulge in that thing but also how much pain you experience when you don't 
      have it and you can now start to let your mind wander into all sorts of examples of addictions or 
      things that you happen to like um I'll use the example that I sometimes use on here which is my 
      love of croissants the taste of that croissant makes me want to eat more croissant now eventually 
      blood sugar goes up satiety is reached Etc what happens then what is s isfaction and satiety about 
      well that's a separate neuromodulator that's about the neuromodulator serotonin it's about 
      oxytocin it's about a hormone system that involves something called prolactin so we're going to 
      talk about all all of those in the book The molecule of more wonderful book uh those were 
      described as the Here and Now molecules the ones that allow you to experience your Sensations and 
      pleasure in the present and for which the brain stops projecting into the future so now let's talk 
      about craving and and the these so-called Here and Now molecules and how those engage in a kind of 
      pushpull balance that will allow you to not just feel more motivated but also to enjoy the things 
      in life that you are pursuing to a much greater degree we have neurons in an area of our brain 
      called the rap r a p he e the RAF releases serotonin at different places in the brain serotonin is 
      the molecule of bliss and contentment for what you already have I've talked before about 
      exteroception exteroception is a focus on the outside world everything beyond the confines of your 
      skin I've also talked about interoception a focus on things that are happening internally within 
      the confines of your skin dopamine and serotonin can be thought of as related to exteroception 
      dopamine makes us focused on things outside us that are beyond what we call our personal space 
      where we actually have to move and take action in order to achieve things and serotonin in general 
      has to do with the things that are in our immediate Here and Now hence the description of these as 
      the Here and Now molecules so it's interesting to point out that the body and the Brain can direct 
      its attention towards things outside us or inside us or split our attention between those just 
      understand that dopamine biases us toward thinking about what we don't have whereas serotonin and 
      some of the related molecules like the endoc canabo if you picked up on the word cannabinoid yes 
      it's like cannabis because cannabis attaches to endoc canabo receptors and the endoc canabo are 
      receptors and chemicals that the cannabinoids that you naturally make that are involved in things 
      like forgetting but you make these molecules that bind to these receptors that make you feel kind 
      of bliss out and content in the present so you got these two systems they're kind of like a push 
      pull and if you were to say do the um you know in the book wherever you go there you are John 
      katzin talks about this meditation practice that's different than most meditation prct ractic is 
      where you eat one almond and you focus all of your attention on the Almond the taste of the Almond 
      the texture of the Almond that's really a mindfulness practice that's geared towards trying to 
      take a behavior which is normally about Pursuit normally feeding is we going we engage in feeding 
      because of dopamine we pursue more of a food because of that pleasure pain relationship I talked 
      about before the focus on the one almond or the or becoming very present in any behavior that 
      normally would be a kind of extra receptive Pursuit behavior and bring it into the here and now 
      that's a mental trick or a mental task that the mindfulness Community has really embraced in order 
      to try and create increased pleasure for what you already have it's really trying to accomplish a 
      shift from dopamine being released to serotonin in the cannabinoid system being involved in that 
      behavior dopamine has the quality of making people kind of rabidly in pursuit of things drugs like 
      marijuana the opioids anything that um really hits the serotonin system hard tend to make people 
      rather lethargic and content to stay exactly where they are they don't want to pursue much at all 
      so you've got these molecules like dopamine that make you focused on the things you want and the 
      things you crave and then you've got the molecules that make you content with what you have so the 
      most important thing perhaps in creating a healthy emotional landscape is to have a balance 
      between these two neuromodulator systems so at about this point in the podcast I'm guessing that 
      some of you are thinking okay great I want more dopamine I want to be more motivated I don't want 
      to procrastinate as much and I want to be able to experience life I want these Here and Now 
      molecules to be released as well well there is a way to do that but you have to understand the 
      source of procrastination is not one thing there are basically two kinds of procrastinators or so 
      says the research the first kind are people that actually really enjoy the stress of the impending 
      deadline it's the only way they can get into action there are other procrastinators for which they 
      simply are not releasing enough dopamine for those people there are a variety of things that can 
      increase dopamine I do suggest you talk to a psychiatrist or doctor I've talked about makuna 
      purines which is 99.9% L Doopa the precursor to dopamine there are anti-depressants like 
      Wellbutrin Bryon is the other name for it which increase dopamine and epinephrine however if you 
      think back to our earlier discussion about dopamine dopamine if it's very high creates a sense of 
      pleasure and the desire for more so you can also become a person for which enough is Never Enough 
      the only thing that dopamine really wants is more of the thing that releases dopamine and so one 
      of the things that you can do in order to generally just be a happier person especially if you're 
      a person in pursuit of long-term goals of any kind is the longer that you can extend that positive 
      phase of the dopamine release and the more that you can blunt the pain response to that the better 
      and you can actually do this cognitively I used to joke with my lab that when we'd publish a paper 
      I would get really excited but I wouldn't allow myself to get too excited what I wanted to do 
      instead and what I've still tried to do is try and extend the Arc of that positive experience as 
      long as I possibly can simply by thinking back like oh that was really cool I really enjoy doing 
      that work I really enjoyed the discovery I really enjoyed doing that with the people that I was 
      working with at the time what a pleasure that was so you can extend pleasure without having to 
      engage in the behavior over and over that's extending the Arc of that dopamine release as well it 
      offsets some of the pain of not having that experience occur over and over and over again now for 
      the high performers out there you're probably familiar with this many people who have a big 
      achievement their first thoughts are well now what what am I going to do next how am I ever going 
      to exceed that and indeed many people who are very high on this kind of dopamine sensation and 
      novelty-seeking scale uh are prone to addiction they're prone to the Rabid pursuit of external 
      goals of exter reception to the neglect of these internal mechanisms that allow them to feel calm 
      and happy so for people that are very driven very motivated adopting a practice of being able to 
      engage in the here and now the sort of omen type practices we talked about earlier um of learning 
      how to achieve a really good night's sleep on a regular basis through tools and mechanisms I 
      talked about in previous podcast gives us sort of balance to the pleasure seeking and offsetting 
      of pain and the pleasure in the here and now so pleasure is really two things it's a joy in 
      Pursuit but it's also the joy in what you have the cool thing is you can actually regulate this 
      whole system in a way that will steer you or lean you towards more positive anticipation of things 
      in life and less disappointment it's simply a matter of adjusting what we call the dopamine 
      schedule in order to understand how to control the dopamine system how to leverage it for a better 
      life you need to understand the results of a very important experiment this experiment was able to 
      separate pleasure from motivation it's a very simple but like many simple experiments a very 
      elegant experiment what they did and this has now been done in animals and in humans they offered 
      rats food it was a food that they particularly liked and the animals would lever press for rep 
      pellet of food kind of classic experiment they'd eat the food and they presumably like the food 
      because they were motivated to press the lever and eat it great they took other rats they 
      eliminated the dopamine neurons you can do this by injection of a neurotoxin that destroys these 
      neurons so they actually had no dopamine in their brain they have no ability to release dopamine 
      and they gave them a lever the rats would sit there and they'd hit the lever and they'd eat the 
      food they're still enjoyed the food so you say well okay so dopamine isn't involved in motivation 
      it isn't involved in pleasure no it absolutely is they could still enjoy the food but if they 
      moved the rat literally one body length away from the lever what they found was the animals that 
      had dopamine would move over to the lever press it and eat and the ones the rats that did not have 
      dopamine available to them wouldn't even move one body length one rat length to the lever in order 
      to press it and get the food dopamine therefore is not about the ability to experience pleasure it 
      is about motivation for pleasure and so many of you are probably thinking wow I'm not a very 
      motivated person like you talked about the one kind of procrastination earlier what about when I 
      just feel kind of meh about life now for some of you there may be a real clinical depression and 
      you should talk to a professional there are very good prescription drugs that can really help 
      people there's also great non-drug treatments of uh Psychotherapy and other treatments that are 
      being developed in addition to psychotherapy and the various kinds of psychoanalysis Etc that one 
      can use I think the data really point to the fact that a combination of pharmacology and talk 
      therapies are generally best and there are a huge range of these things I know many of you are in 
      these professions so we're not going to talk about that right now there is a compound that's kind 
      of interesting in the supplement space that isn't um munan alopa it's not El tyrosine that isn't 
      promoting massive releases of dopamine or even dopamine alone but a combination of dopamine and 
      serotonin and it's an intriguing molecule it's um sold over the counter again you have to check 
      with your Healthcare um uh provider before you would take anything or remove anything that's very 
      important but it's phenol ethyl amine or pea pea or beta phenol ethyl aiming releases dopamine at 
      low levels but also serotonin at low level so it's kind of a cocktail of the motivation molecules 
      as well as the quote unquote Here and Now molecules and people's response to this varies widely 
      but many people report feeling heightened sense of mental acuity well-being Etc it is a bit of a 
      stimulant like anything that triggers activation of the dopamine and norepinephrine pathway but is 
      an interesting supplement so now let's talk about what is a dopamine schedule and how you can 
      leverage this in order to have heightened levels of motivation but not get so much dopamine that 
      you're experiencing a crash afterwards and also so that you can experience heightened pleasure 
      from the various Pursuits that you are engaged in in life and here's the key principle dopamine is 
      very subjective meaning you can either allow yourself to experience the pleasure of reaching a 
      milestone of a achieving or some craving or not it's actually pretty powerful what one can do with 
      the subjective system in fact I'm going to describe you an experiment that highlights just how 
      powerful the subjective readout or the subjective interpretation of a given experience really can 
      be even at the level of pharmacology and the title of the experiment is expectation for stimulant 
      type modifies caffeine's effects on mood and cognition this was done in college students it's a f 
      fascinating study what they did is they gave college students either Placebo essentially nothing 
      or 200 milligrams of caffeine 200 milligrams of caffeine is about what's in a typical coffee like 
      a medium coffee that you would buy a drip coffee so they took 65 undergraduate students in college
       they randomized them to either Placebo or caffeine and they told them that they were either 
       getting caffeine or adero now Aderall cognitively carries a very different um expectation college
        students know Aderall to be a much stronger stimulant than caffeine they know it to create a 
        sort of high this is the way the students described it and they thought that it would increase 
        their level of focus and their ability to perform work so what's really interesting is there was
         definitely an effect of placebo versus caffeine that's not surprising however right you take a 
         placebo you may or may not feel more alert um but you take 200 milligrams of caffeine very 
         likely you're going to feel very alert but there was also an effect of whether or not the 
         students thought they were getting caffeine or Aderall the subjects receiving caffeine reported
          feeling more stimulated anxious and motivated than the subjects that received the placebo okay
           but the ones that expected Aderall reported stronger amphetamine effects they performed 
           better on a working memory test and in general they had all the increased cognitive effects 
           that would have been seen with adol but they were only ingesting caffeine so it led to 
           heightened performance simply because the students thought they were getting Aderall and I 
           think this is very important because I think that it points to the fact that the the the top 
           down the kind of higher level cognitive processes are impacting even the most basic 
           fundamental aspects of say dopamine release or our uh adrenaline release or epinephrine 
           release in ways that can positively impact performance in this case it was a positive 
           Improvement in working memory and focus so today we've talked a lot about the dopamine system
            and and those kinds of schedules that will allow craving or addiction but what's the 
            schedule of dopamine that's going to allow you to maximize on your pursuit of pleasure and 
            your elimination of pain and we get the answer to that from our good friend gambling the 
            reason gambling works the reason why people will throw their lives away the reason why 
            people go back again and again and again to places like Las Vegas and Atlantic City is 
            because of the hope and anticipation it's a those are cities and places built on dopamine 
            they are leveraging your dopamine system and as a friend of mine who's a certified addiction
             treatment specialist tells me that you know gambling addiction is a particularly Sinister 
             because the next time really could be the thing that changes everything unlike other 
             addictions the next time really could change everything and that's embedded in the mind of 
             the gambling addict and rarely does it work out uh in favor of the well-being of the 
             gambling addict and their family however the intermittent reinforcement schedule was 
             discovered Long Ago by scientific researchers so this is the slot machine that every once 
             in a while gives you a win to keep you playing this is the the probability of winning on 
             the craps table or the roulette table or at Blackjack just often enough that you're willing
              to buy tickets head out there play again go downstairs again from your room even though 
              you swear you were done for the night intermittent reinforcement is the most powerful form 
              of dopamine reward schedule to keep you doing something so we can export that we can use 
              it for good if there's something that you're pursuing in life whether or not it's an 
              academic goal or a financial goal or relationship goal one of the things that you can do 
              to ensure that you will remain on the path to that goal for a very long time and that you 
              will continue to exceed your previous performance as well as continue to enjoy the 
              dopamine Rel that occurs when you hit the Milestones that you want to achieve is to 
              occasionally remove reward subjectively let's say you set out a goal of making I'm going 
              to make this quantitative with respect to finances because it just is an easy description
               but this could also be in sport this could be in school this could be in music could be 
               in anything creative Endeavors but let's say you set out a certain Financial goal or 
               let's say you want to get a certain number of followers on whatever social media platform
                as you reach each one of those goals you should know now that the amount of dopamine is 
                not going to Peak it's actually going to diminish and make you crave more the key to 
                avoiding that crash but to still keep it in healthy levels that will allow you to 
                continue your Pursuit is as you are staircasing toward your goal you actually want to 
                blunt the reward response for some of those intermediate goals now I'm not telling you 
                you shouldn't celebrate your wins but I'm telling you not to celebrate all of them or as
                 a good friend of mine who uh recently uh fortunately for him uh had a great financial 
                 success he asked me and somebody else a good friend of mine who's very tuned into 
                 dopamine reward schedules understands how they work at a really deep level and he said 
                 I don't know what to do next and we said oh well that's simple you should just give 
                 most of it away and this wasn't a ploy to receive any of the money ourselves this was 
                 really about reducing the impact of that reward now hopefully giving him money away if 
                 you already have enough of it would be something that was rewarding in and of itself 
                 but if you're a student who's pursuing goals in University or you're an athlete who's 
                 pursuing goals it actually makes sense from a rational perspective once you understand 
                 these mechanisms to hit a new high point of performance or to get that A+ or for you if
                  it's an A minus Etc and to tell yourself okay that was good but to actually actively 
                  blunt the reward to not go and celebrate too intensely because in doing that you keep 
                  your dopamine system in check and you ensure that you're going to stay on the path of 
                  continued Pursuit not just for that thing but for all things big increases in dopamine
                   lead to big crashes in dopamine and big increases in dopamine up the anti so you can 
                   lift the uh what Las Vegas and Atlantic City and other gambling uh mechanisms and 
                   places have known for a long time they lifted it from the scientists you can now take
                    it back and you can start to leverage that and you just make it intermittent you 
                    reward yourself not on a predictable schedule so not every other time or every third
                     time or every 10th time but sometimes it's three in a row then not at all for 10 
                     days so reward is important self-reward is critically important but make sure that 
                     you're not doing it on such a predictable schedule that you burn out these dopamine
                      circuits or that you undercut your own ability to strive and Achieve hopefully you
                       now know far more about the dopamine system reward and motivation than you did at
                       the beginning of this podcast hopefully you also understand the other side of 
                       dopamine and reward which is pain and the balance of this pleasure pain system as
                        well as the molecules that we call or that were described in the molecule of 
                        more book I should say as the Here and Now molecules things like serotonin and 
                        the endoc canabo finally I want to thank you for your time and attention today I
                         hope you learned a lot and that you learned a lot of possible tools that you 
                         could incorporate into your life as it relates to motivation and emotions thank 
                         you for your interest in science.
